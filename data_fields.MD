Tip: In all cases, movingDurationInSeconds <= timerDurationInSeconds <= clockDurationInSeconds.
For example, a user is going for a run. He starts the timer at exactly noon. At 12:30 he pauses the timer
(Either manually or using auto-pause) to stop and chat with a friend, and at 12:35 he resumes the timer.
At 12:40 he stands still for 2 minutes, waiting on a traffic signal at a busy intersection, then finishes his run and
manually stops the timer at 1:00 pm.

clockDurationInSeconds = 60 minutes (12:00 - 1:00)
timerDurationInSeconds = 55 minutes (12:00-12:30 + 12:35-1:00)
movingDurationInSeconds = 53 minutes (12:00-12:30 + 12:35-12:40 + 12:42-1:00)

Activity Details records may also contain lap data indicating when the user initiated a new lap, either
manually or by Auto Lap functionality (https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/vivoactive3/EN-
US/GUID-97010D91-30E5-42CD-871D-ED17CA77C5AC.html). Each lap object contains the following:

| Property           | Type    | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| startTimeInSeconds | integer | Start time of the lap in seconds since Jan |
